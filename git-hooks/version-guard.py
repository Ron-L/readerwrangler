version-guard.py — RW pre-commit chokepoint for version stamps. Called by git-hooks/pre-commit (run by git; saved in
the repo since 2026-10-15 — it used to live in the unsaved .claude/hooks/).

WHY: nothing enforced the "every runtime change gets a version bump" rule. The pre-build
gate (gate-check.py) is only an 11-point CHECKLIST — it never verifies the version actually
moved — so a bump could be silently forgotten (7.18.0-alpha.19 shipped without one; the
on-screen build marker lagged at alpha.18 until Ron caught it). This makes the bump STRUCTURAL:
a commit that touches shipped code but forgets its version stamp is refused.

RULE — for each STAGED code file, its version stamp must ALSO change in the same commit:

  readerwrangler.js   -> ORGANIZER_VERSION  (internal const, same file)
  mobile.js           -> MOBILE_VERSION      (internal const, same file)
  relay/relay-worker.js -> WORKER_VERSION    (internal const, same file — shown in the relay's emails)
  <module>.js         -> its  <module>.js?v=  cache-buster line in readerwrangler.html
  readerwrangler.css  -> its  readerwrangler.css?v=  cache-buster line in readerwrangler.html

<module>.js are the local scripts readerwrangler.html loads with a ?v= buster. readerwrangler.js
and mobile.js are the exceptions: their HTML buster is APP_VERSION (frozen during alpha testing),
so they carry an INTERNAL const that bumps every alpha instead.

Deliberate exception (Ron's call only, per CLAUDE.md): git commit --no-verify.
