# TODO

## Prioritized Roadmap (By Priority & Complexity)

_Based on user requirements + Claude.ai independent review (CLAUDE-AI-REVIEW.md)_

---

### 🎯 Priority 1: Top Personal Priorities

**1. ☁️ Multi-Device Sync** #Architecture - LOW/VERY HIGH (40-60 hours)
   - Cloud storage option (self-hosted or encrypted)
   - Sync organization across devices
   - **TODO**: Test Dropbox integration as potential solution
   - Problem: Major architectural change, privacy implications
   - Impact: Convenience for multi-device users

**2. 📜 Horizontal & Vertical Scroll for Main View** - LOW/LOW (1-2 hours)
   - Add horizontal scrollbar when columns exceed viewport width
   - Add vertical scrollbar for main content area (columns already have per-column scroll)
   - Problem: With many columns or narrow viewport, users can't access off-screen columns
   - Impact: Basic usability for users with many columns or smaller screens

**3. 🖼️ Cover Image Caching** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (6-10 hours)
   - Cache book cover images locally to reduce Amazon requests and speed up load times
   - Options to investigate:
     - Service Worker caching (browser-managed, respects cache headers)
     - IndexedDB blob storage (more control, but more code)
     - File System Access API (user-chosen folder, requires interaction)
   - Note: Amazon may return cache-unfriendly headers; check DevTools Network tab
   - Consider Amazon ToS implications for storing their images
   - Problem: Covers refetch on every page load, slow experience, hammers Amazon servers
   - Impact: Faster load times, works offline, reduced bandwidth

**4. 📝 Book Notes** - LOW/LOW (2-3 hours)
   - Personal notes on individual books ("Why did I buy this?", "Who recommended it?")
   - See [docs/design/BOOK-NOTES.md](docs/design/BOOK-NOTES.md) for full spec
   - Sticky note styling in detail modal (matches landing page brand element)
   - Entry points: "Add Note" button in modal, right-click context menu
   - Auto-save on blur/escape, no explicit save button
   - Problem: Book descriptions don't always capture why you bought or want to read a book
   - Impact: Personal context preserved with each book

**5. 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Sharing Info** - LOW/LOW (2-4 hours)
   - See [docs/design/FAMILY-SHARING.md](docs/design/FAMILY-SHARING.md) for full spec
   - Fetch which books user has shared with family members
   - Display "Shared with: Name" in book detail modal
   - API tested: supports batch of 1000+ ASINs in single call (~200ms)
   - Implementation: Add to collections fetcher, display in organizer
   - Problem: No visibility into which books are shared with family
   - Impact: Better awareness of Family Library sharing status

**6. 📖 Reading Progress Visualization** - MEDIUM/HIGH (6-10 hours)
   - Show reading progress percentage/position for each book
   - Implementation guidance: [Amazon Organizer Reading Progress conversation](https://claude.ai/chat/6e6f23c8-b84e-4900-8c64-fecb6a6e0bd1)
   - Note: Collections data already merged (line 452 LOG.md), this adds progress visualization
   - Problem: Users can't see reading progress in organizer
   - Impact: Better tracking of currently-reading books

---

### ✨ Priority 2: High Priority Features

**1. 🗑️ Orphan Detection & Recycle Bin** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (9-13 hours)
   - Detect books no longer in Amazon library after re-import
   - Recycle Bin virtual column for soft-deleted books
   - See [docs/design/ORPHAN-DETECTION-RECYCLE-BIN.md](docs/design/ORPHAN-DETECTION-RECYCLE-BIN.md) for full spec
   - Problem: Orphaned books (samples replaced by purchase, returns, expired subscriptions) clutter library
   - Impact: Clean library management, safe deletion with restore capability

**2. 🔄 Phase 3 Retry Logic + Recovery + Pause/Resume** - MEDIUM/HIGH (12-16 hours, optional)
   - See [docs/design/PHASE-3-RETRY-LOGIC.md](docs/design/PHASE-3-RETRY-LOGIC.md) for full spec
   - Retry logic for failed enrichments (~1.3% failure rate)
   - Pause/Resume capability with global flag + button UI
   - Recovery: Save extraction state to localStorage, resume from interruption
   - State persistence: Track progress, allow resumption after browser close/refresh
   - **Enriches wishlist items**: Wishlist Fetcher only has access to basic fields (title,
     author, cover, rating, series) from product pages; Pass 3 adds descriptions and reviews
     when user runs Library Fetcher
   - Problem: Random enrichment failures, long extractions without pause, lost progress on interruption
   - Impact: Data quality improvement (99.8%+ expected), better UX for long extractions, prevents data loss
   - Note: This consolidates former P2 "Extraction Error Recovery" feature

**3. 🔧 Refactor readerwrangler.js into Modules** - LOW/MEDIUM (4-6 hours)
   - Current state: 3,862-line monolithic file with 50+ state variables, 80+ functions
   - **Recommended: Minimal Split (4 modules)**

   | Module | ~Lines | Contents |
   |--------|--------|----------|
   | `storage.js` | 150 | IndexedDB, localStorage operations |
   | `dataProcessing.js` | 400 | Import, merge, filter logic |
   | `dragDrop.js` | 500 | Drag handlers, binary search optimization |
   | `uiHelpers.js` | 200 | Formatters, display helpers, constants |
   | `readerwrangler.js` | 1,500 | State, hooks, orchestration, JSX |

   - **Key risks to preserve:**
     - Drag performance uses refs to avoid re-renders - must preserve
     - `loadLibrary()` handles multiple JSON formats - complex parsing
     - 8 filters must stay coordinated
     - State sync between books array and column.books IDs
   - **Alternative: Thorough split (12 files)** with components + custom hooks - cleaner but 2-3 days work
   - Problem: Large monolithic file hard to navigate and maintain
   - Impact: Better code organization, easier future maintenance, testability
   - **Implementation order:**
     1. Extract `uiHelpers.js` (no dependencies)
     2. Extract `storage.js` (only localStorage/IndexedDB)
     3. Extract `dataProcessing.js` (uses above)
     4. Extract `dragDrop.js` (uses uiHelpers)
     5. Update main component imports
   - **Context Menu IIFE** - The context menu positioning (v4.1.0.e) uses an IIFE in JSX to calculate viewport bounds before rendering. Consider extracting to a custom hook or component for cleaner code.

**4. Multi-Store Architecture** #Architecture - LOW/VERY HIGH (60-80 hours)
   - See [docs/design/MULTI-STORE-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/design/MULTI-STORE-ARCHITECTURE.md) for full spec
   - Status: Future enhancement (Amazon first, other stores later)
   - Covers: File naming, bookmarklet detection, data structure, migration path
   - Problem: Only works with Amazon
   - Impact: Support for other ebook platforms

   - Fetch metadata for missing books via Amazon API or series page scraping
   - Auto-populate wishlist with series gaps
   - Series column UI: Show gaps visually (grayed placeholder covers?)
   - **Blockers**:
     - Requires Speed Up Enrichment (completed v3.7.1) to avoid API throttling
     - Amazon's inconsistent series tagging may limit effectiveness
   - Problem: Series readers often have incomplete sets, no easy way to identify gaps
   - Impact: Automatic discovery of missing series books, targeted purchasing
   - **Investigation tasks:**
     - Research Amazon API for series metadata (GraphQL? Product Advertising API?)
     - Test series detection accuracy across sample of 50+ series books
     - Determine if series page scraping is feasible fallback
     - Measure API rate limits for series metadata queries
   - **Subtasks:**
     - Series detection algorithm (pattern matching on titles, author clustering)
     - Series gap identification logic
     - Amazon API integration for missing book metadata
     - Wishlist auto-population workflow
     - Series column UI for gap visualization

**6. ✨ UX Quick Wins** - MEDIUM/LOW (1-3 hours each)
   - Tooltips for control buttons (Backup, Restore, Reset, Clear)
   - First-run Welcome dialog explaining what ReaderWrangler is
   - **Keyboard shortcuts help** - "?" icon or Ctrl+? to show shortcuts dialog (Undo/Redo, multi-select, etc.)
   - Column name filtering (search by column name)
   - Make status dialog draggable/movable (modal → draggable)
   - **Drag Divider by Title Area** - Click-drag on divider title text (not just ⋮ handle) to reposition. Must not conflict with double-click to rename.
   - **More Auto-Divide Helpers** - Auto-Divide by Author, by Acquisition Date (Year groups), by Page Count (Short/Medium/Long). All use same divider infrastructure.
