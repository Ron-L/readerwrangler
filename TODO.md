# TODO

## Current Priorities (Active Development)

_What we're actively working on right now_

### 1. README Enrichment Failures Documentation - PENDING

- [ ] **Document enrichment failures in README.md** - LOW priority (15 min)
  - Explain that a small number of books (~0.1-0.2%) may fail enrichment due to Amazon API quirks
  - Frame as Amazon-side limitation we accept (not a bug)
  - Optional: Mention Phase 3 retry logic may be added in future to recover missing enrichments on subsequent fetches
  - Context: Phase 2.6 investigation found partial GraphQL errors affect ~3-5 books per 2600+ library

### 2. Development Process Improvements

- [ ] Consider adding "grep for TODO comments in code files" to release procedure in ground rules
  - Review all in-code TODOs before finalizing release
  - Ensures temporary code doesn't become permanent

### 3. Status Bar Redesign (v3.7.0) - IN PROGRESS

**Goal**: Simplify status display with user-first urgency indicators based on Load state only

**Design Document**: [docs/design/STATUS-BAR-REDESIGN.md](docs/design/STATUS-BAR-REDESIGN.md) - Full rationale, architecture, and 25-state matrix

**Implementation Tasks**:

**Phase 1: Add GUID + fetchDate to fetchers**
- [x] Generate GUID in library-fetcher.js, add to JSON metadata (v3.4.0.a)
- [ ] Generate GUID in collections-fetcher.js, add to JSON metadata
- [ ] Add `metadata.fetchDate` to Collections JSON (currently missing)

**Phase 2: Fetcher writes manifest to IndexedDB**
- [x] Library fetcher: write manifest to IndexedDB after generating JSON (v3.4.0.a)
- [ ] Collections fetcher: write manifest to IndexedDB after generating JSON
- [x] Use same IndexedDB database as organizer app (ReaderWranglerManifests)

**Phase 3: App reads from IndexedDB**
- [ ] On app load: read manifests from IndexedDB
- [ ] On JSON load: match GUID to find corresponding manifest
- [ ] Calculate Fetch state from manifest, Load state from JSON metadata
- [ ] Handle missing/mismatched GUID gracefully

**Phase 4: Remove old polling code**
- [ ] Delete `amazon-manifest.json` file generation
- [ ] Remove `checkManifest()` function and 60-second timer
- [ ] Remove `manifestData` React state
- [ ] Remove `MANIFEST_CHECK_INTERVAL` constant

**Phase 5: New status bar UI**
- [x] Remove version from status bar header (v3.7.0.o)
- [ ] Single-line: "Data Status: ✅" (or ⚠️ or 🛑 or ❓)
- [ ] Tooltip shows summary
- [ ] Click opens status dialog with full 25-state details

## Prioritized Roadmap (By Priority & Complexity)

_Based on user requirements + Claude.ai independent review (CLAUDE-AI-REVIEW.md)_

### 🔥 Priority 1: Critical Documentation & Onboarding (HIGH Priority, LOW-MEDIUM Complexity)

1. **🚀 Speed Up Enrichment Fetching** #FetcherImprovements - HIGH/MEDIUM (4-6 hours) - See [docs/design/FETCHER-IMPROVEMENTS.md](docs/design/FETCHER-IMPROVEMENTS.md)
    - Problem: Current 1-ASIN-per-call + 2-second delay = 2+ hours for 2000+ books (showstopper for adoption)
    - Solution: Fetch 30 ASINs per call like Amazon yourbooks page does
    - Investigation tasks:
      - Analyze yourbooks page network traffic (verify 30 books = 1 API call)
      - Measure safe timing between batch calls
      - Identify Amazon's throttling patterns
    - Implementation:
      - Update GraphQL query to accept ASIN array
      - Batch ASINs into groups of 30
      - Adjust delay based on yourbooks behavior analysis
      - Add exponential backoff for rate limit handling
    - Expected impact: 13-33x speedup (2+ hours → 5-10 minutes)
    - Context: Must address before creating training videos/USER-GUIDE updates

2. **📖 Quick Start Video & Written Guide** - HIGH/LOW (2-4 hours) - See [docs/design/VIDEO-PRODUCTION-PLAN.md](docs/design/VIDEO-PRODUCTION-PLAN.md)

### 🎯 Priority 2: UX Polish & Error Handling (HIGH Priority, LOW-MEDIUM Complexity)

8. **⏱️ Enhanced Progress Feedback During Extraction** - HIGH/LOW-MEDIUM (1-2 hours)
   - Progress counter during enrichment: "847 of 2,322 books (36%)" - 30 min
   - Visual progress bar with smooth updates - 1 hour
   - Problem: Users get impatient/confused during lengthy initial extraction (especially enrichment phase)
   - Impact: Reduces abandonment during first-time setup
   - Note: Pause/Resume + Recovery moved to Phase 3 Retry Logic (item #23)

9. **🔄 Extraction Error Recovery** - SHOULD MOVE TO PHASE 3 RETRY LOGIC
   - Note: This overlaps significantly with Phase 3 Retry Logic (item #23)
   - Recovery, Pause/Resume, and state persistence all belong together
   - Recommend consolidating into item #23 for cohesive implementation

10. **🐛 Collections Filter Bug Fix** - HIGH/LOW (30m-1h)
   - Collections dropdown still shows old collection names after Clear Everything
   - Problem: UI state not fully cleared
