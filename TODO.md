## Prioritized Roadmap (By Priority & Complexity)

_Based on user requirements + Claude.ai independent review (CLAUDE-AI-REVIEW.md)_

---

### 🎯 Priority 1: Top Personal Priorities

**0-A. 🐛 Data Status shows green checkmark when Collections empty** - LOW/LOW (1 hour)
   - Status bar shows green checkmark overall even when Collections shows "Not loaded"
   - Data Status modal shows "Collections: Not loaded" with old date but no actual data
   - Should show warning/stale indicator when Collections data is missing
   - Problem: Misleading status indicator suggests all is well when data is incomplete

**0-B. 🐛 Collections Fetcher fails with SecurityError on file save** - LOW/LOW (1-2 hours)
   - Error: `SecurityError: Failed to execute 'createWritable' on 'FileSystemFileHandle': User activation is required to request permissions`
   - Same issue fixed in Library Fetcher - Chrome requires user interaction to refresh file write permission
   - UI shows "Saving Library (Elapsed 0)" but freezes - no error message shown
   - Collections Fetcher runs faster, so didn't hit timing issue before; Chrome may have tightened
   - Fix: Add same permission refresh button/interaction as Library Fetcher

**0-C. 🐛 Column counts include dividers** - LOW/LOW (30 min)
   - Column header shows count of all items (books + dividers)
   - When filtering, reduced count still includes dividers
   - Should count only books, not dividers
   - Problem: Misleading count - user expects book count, not total item count

**1. 📝 Book Notes** - LOW/LOW (2-3 hours)
   - Personal notes on individual books ("Why did I buy this?", "Who recommended it?")
   - See [docs/design/BOOK-NOTES.md](docs/design/BOOK-NOTES.md) for full spec
   - Sticky note styling in detail modal (matches landing page brand element)
   - Entry points: "Add Note" button in modal, right-click context menu
   - Auto-save on blur/escape, no explicit save button
   - Problem: Book descriptions don't always capture why you bought or want to read a book
   - Impact: Personal context preserved with each book

**2. 🏷️ Tags** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (8-12 hours)
   - Tags for books (explicit) and divs (positional inheritance)
   - See [docs/design/TAGS.md](docs/design/TAGS.md) for full spec
   - Books inherit div tags while under that div; lost when moved out
   - Tag filter with autocomplete; hide empty columns/divs when filtering
   - Display: explicit tags (bold) first, inherited (faded) second, alphabetical
   - Problem: Can't find thematically related books (Time Travel, Military SF) across 100+ columns
   - Impact: Cross-library thematic organization, reduced scrolling through empty columns

**3. 🎠 Column Carousel** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (8-12 hours)
   - Infinite horizontal carousel for columns (excludes pinned columns)
   - See [docs/design/COLUMN-CAROUSEL.md](docs/design/COLUMN-CAROUSEL.md) for full spec
   - Click-to-pin columns to left side; pinned columns exit carousel
   - Momentum-based spinning with mouse wheel, edge hover zones, keyboard arrows
   - 3D perspective: edge columns at 85% scale/opacity, center at 100%
   - Mobile: swipe to spin, carousel locks during book drag
   - Problem: 7+ columns becomes unwieldy with linear horizontal scroll
   - Impact: Scalable navigation for large column counts (20+)

**4. 📚 Series Page Bulk Import** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (6-10 hours)
   - See [docs/design/SERIES-PAGE-BULK-IMPORT.md](docs/design/SERIES-PAGE-BULK-IMPORT.md) for full spec
   - Bulk import all books from an Amazon series page as wishlist entries
   - Destroyer series Reference URL: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D775V4W9?binding=kindle_edition
   - API: `/kindle-dbs/productPage/ajax/seriesAsinList?asin=X&pageNumber=1&pageSize=200`
   - Single request with pageSize=200 returns all available books
   - Creates wishlist entries (isOwned: false) for books not already owned
   - **Known limitation:** Amazon data gaps (e.g., 155-book series missing books 101-149 from Kindle catalog)
   - Related to P1 T6 Wishlist Price Tracking for full workflow
   - Problem: Adding 100+ books from a series requires visiting each product page individually
   - Impact: One-click bulk wishlist population for entire series

**5. 💰 Wishlist Price Tracking** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (6-10 hours)
   - Fetch current prices for wishlist books from Amazon product pages
   - Target price field in wishlist book data
   - Filter in APP: show wishlist books with current price ≤ target price
   - Implementation options:
     - Add to Library Fetcher (scrape prices during existing fetch)
     - Separate bookmarklet option with dedicated price lookup script
   - Replaces manual eReaderIQ workflow for price monitoring
   - Problem: Jumping between ReaderWrangler and eReaderIQ for price tracking
   - Impact: Streamlined wishlist-to-purchase workflow

---

### ✨ Priority 2: High Priority Features

**1. 👨‍👩‍👧 Family Sharing Info** - LOW/LOW (2-4 hours)
   - See [docs/design/FAMILY-SHARING.md](docs/design/FAMILY-SHARING.md) for full spec
   - Fetch which books user has shared with family members
   - Display "Shared with: Name" in book detail modal
   - API tested: supports batch of 1000+ ASINs in single call (~200ms)
   - Implementation: Add to collections fetcher, display in organizer
   - Problem: No visibility into which books are shared with family
   - Impact: Better awareness of Family Library sharing status

**2. 📖 Reading Progress Visualization** - MEDIUM/HIGH (6-10 hours)
   - Show reading progress percentage/position for each book
   - Implementation guidance: [Amazon Organizer Reading Progress conversation](https://claude.ai/chat/6e6f23c8-b84e-4900-8c64-fecb6a6e0bd1)
   - Note: Collections data already merged (line 452 LOG.md), this adds progress visualization
   - Problem: Users can't see reading progress in organizer
   - Impact: Better tracking of currently-reading books

**3. 🗑️ Orphan Detection & Recycle Bin** - MEDIUM/MEDIUM (9-13 hours)
   - Detect books no longer in Amazon library after re-import
   - Recycle Bin virtual column for soft-deleted books
   - See [docs/design/ORPHAN-DETECTION-RECYCLE-BIN.md](docs/design/ORPHAN-DETECTION-RECYCLE-BIN.md) for full spec
   - Problem: Orphaned books (samples replaced by purchase, returns, expired subscriptions) clutter library
   - Impact: Clean library management, safe deletion with restore capability

**4. 🔄 Phase 3 Retry Logic + Recovery + Pause/Resume** - MEDIUM/HIGH (12-16 hours, optional)
   - See [docs/design/PHASE-3-RETRY-LOGIC.md](docs/design/PHASE-3-RETRY-LOGIC.md) for full spec
   - Retry logic for failed enrichments (~1.3% failure rate)
   - Pause/Resume capability with global flag + button UI
   - Recovery: Save extraction state to localStorage, resume from interruption
   - State persistence: Track progress, allow resumption after browser close/refresh
   - **Enriches wishlist items**: Wishlist Fetcher only has access to basic fields (title,
     author, cover, rating, series) from product pages; Pass 3 adds descriptions and reviews
     when user runs Library Fetcher
   - Problem: Random enrichment failures, long extractions without pause, lost progress on interruption
   - Impact: Data quality improvement (99.8%+ expected), better UX for long extractions, prevents data loss
   - Note: This consolidates former P2 "Extraction Error Recovery" feature

**5. 🔧 Refactor readerwrangler.js into Modules** - LOW/MEDIUM (4-6 hours)
   - Current state: 3,862-line monolithic file with 50+ state variables, 80+ functions
   - **Recommended: Minimal Split (4 modules)**

   | Module | ~Lines | Contents |
   |--------|--------|----------|
   | `storage.js` | 150 | IndexedDB, localStorage operations |
   | `dataProcessing.js` | 400 | Import, merge, filter logic |
   | `dragDrop.js` | 500 | Drag handlers, binary search optimization |
   | `uiHelpers.js` | 200 | Formatters, display helpers, constants |
   | `readerwrangler.js` | 1,500 | State, hooks, orchestration, JSX |

   - **Key risks to preserve:**
     - Drag performance uses refs to avoid re-renders - must preserve
     - `loadLibrary()` handles multiple JSON formats - complex parsing
     - 8 filters must stay coordinated
     - State sync between books array and column.books IDs
   - **Alternative: Thorough split (12 files)** with components + custom hooks - cleaner but 2-3 days work
   - Problem: Large monolithic file hard to navigate and maintain
   - Impact: Better code organization, easier future maintenance, testability
   - **Implementation order:**
     1. Extract `uiHelpers.js` (no dependencies)
     2. Extract `storage.js` (only localStorage/IndexedDB)
     3. Extract `dataProcessing.js` (uses above)
     4. Extract `dragDrop.js` (uses uiHelpers)
     5. Update main component imports
   - **Context Menu IIFE** - The context menu positioning (v4.1.0.e) uses an IIFE in JSX to calculate viewport bounds before rendering. Consider extracting to a custom hook or component for cleaner code.

**6. Multi-Store Architecture** #Architecture - LOW/VERY HIGH (60-80 hours)
   - See [docs/design/MULTI-STORE-ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/design/MULTI-STORE-ARCHITECTURE.md) for full spec
   - Status: Future enhancement (Amazon first, other stores later)
   - Covers: File naming, bookmarklet detection, data structure, migration path
   - Problem: Only works with Amazon
   - Impact: Support for other ebook platforms

**5. 🎯 Wishlist Integration - Series Gap Detection** #Optional - MEDIUM/VERY HIGH (20-30 hours)
   - Automatic series detection for owned books (requires series metadata)
   - Identify missing books in series (e.g., own books 1, 2, 4 but not 3)
   - Fetch metadata for missing books via Amazon API or series page scraping
   - Auto-populate wishlist with series gaps
   - Series column UI: Show gaps visually (grayed placeholder covers?)
   - **Blockers**:
     - Requires Speed Up Enrichment (completed v3.7.1) to avoid API throttling
     - Amazon's inconsistent series tagging may limit effectiveness
   - Problem: Series readers often have incomplete sets, no easy way to identify gaps
   - Impact: Automatic discovery of missing series books, targeted purchasing
   - **Investigation tasks:**
     - Research Amazon API for series metadata (GraphQL? Product Advertising API?)
     - Test series detection accuracy across sample of 50+ series books
     - Determine if series page scraping is feasible fallback
     - Measure API rate limits for series metadata queries
   - **Subtasks:**
     - Series detection algorithm (pattern matching on titles, author clustering)
     - Series gap identification logic
     - Amazon API integration for missing book metadata
     - Wishlist auto-population workflow
     - Series column UI for gap visualization

**6. ✨ UX Quick Wins** - MEDIUM/LOW (1-3 hours each)
   - Tooltips for control buttons (Backup, Restore, Reset, Clear)
   - First-run Welcome dialog explaining what ReaderWrangler is
   - **Keyboard shortcuts help** - "?" icon or Ctrl+? to show shortcuts dialog (Undo/Redo, multi-select, etc.)
   - Column name filtering (search by column name)
   - Make status dialog draggable/movable (modal → draggable)
   - **Drag Divider by Title Area** - Click-drag on divider title text (not just ⋮ handle) to reposition. Must not conflict with double-click to rename.
   - **More Auto-Divide Helpers** - Auto-Divide by Author, by Acquisition Date (Year groups), by Page Count (Short/Medium/Long). All use same divider infrastructure.
