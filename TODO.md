## 🔝 TOP OF STACK (Ron 2026-09-09/10)

- [ ] **Ctrl+X from a Book List / Search view silently degrades to copy** (found during alpha.7, filed not fixed):
  cut records the view id as source, but paste-cut removes from FOLDERS only — the book never leaves the list.
  Fix: refuse with the explanatory toast (like All Books) or make paste-cut honor Book List sources.


- [ ] **Book dialog goes fully transactional (7.11.0, ratified 2026-09-10 — fresh branch AFTER 7.10.1 ships)**:
  in the dialog, Edit/Save is the ONLY way anything changes (one undo per Save); everywhere else changes are
  instant commands (one undo each). Rating / price goal / tags leave view mode (read-only displays) and join
  `editBookFields` as staged fields — Cancel discards, Save folds them into the one atomic EDIT_BOOK step;
  new-tag creation happens at Save. Finishes the OWNERSHIP-MODEL §4 edit-in-place pattern (instant controls
  were the anomaly). Commands stay live in both modes (Share, Amazon link, Status History, ◀▶) — build starts
  with an enumeration pass classifying every dialog control field-vs-command (explicit, not vibes).
  **Quick access replaces dialog instant-set**: line-view cell popups for Price Goal + My Rating (click cell →
  preset goals/custom, or star row); decide during build whether cover right-click gains a My Rating submenu.
  UNDO-MODEL.md §"fully transactional" has the rationale + Ron's context-keying principle.


- [ ] **Second-generation coverage audit** — Ron's Tag-Manager rename (Adult→Mainstream) exposed TWO classes the
  alpha.4 audits never scanned: the rename wasn't recorded (audit keyed on `saveBooksToIndexedDB` = book-array
  writes only) AND Ctrl+Z passed through the dialog to the global book stack (fence exists only on book-detail).
  Three sweeps: **(A)** all NON-book persistence writers (tag registry, folders, Book Lists, saved Searches,
  settings) × undoable? receipt? — non-undoable must be a recorded decision, not an accident; **(B)** modal ×
  live-global-shortcut matrix (alpha.5 fixed X/C/V/Delete; what else passes up? Ctrl+A, arrows, F2…);
  **(C)** fence policy per modal — every modal either has its own fence (records undoables, e.g. Tag Manager
  once RENAME_TAG exists) or blocks Ctrl+Z with the info toast; NO silent forwarding to the global stack.
  Tag Manager fix (RENAME_TAG action + receipt + fence) falls out of the audit.

## ⏸️ Ownership-honesty batch (ratified 2026-09-04, HELD — awaiting Ron's go; likely 7.8.0)

Shipped so far: item 0 + ownership-dialog redesign + undo fence + undo-toast naming → **7.8.0** (2026-09-08);
item 10 → **7.7.2** (2026-09-07; prod proof outstanding — first prod import on ≥7.7.2 should log
`🧹 Reclaimed 7 absorbed bulk run(s)`, ~124MB).
**Unified Auto-Organize SHIPPED as 7.9.0** (2026-09-09; 9 soak-tested alphas in 2 days — the soak-as-test-rig
model at full speed). Two §9/§2 pieces deliberately deferred (explicitly, per the scope rule):
- [ ] **Inbox as a File-under target** (demote a mis-filed book back out) — different commit machinery
- [ ] **Shift-click ranges follow VISUAL order** — still internal-array order; diverges in series mode + grouped Already-filed
Then item 11, then batch 1-9. (Item 12 — mooted by the unification.)

Save as Spreadsheet (CSV): **SHIPPED as 7.10.0** (2026-09-09 — requested 09-08, shipped next day).
Reply to the user still owed (Ron's channel).
- [ ] **1. Fetcher completion dialog reports ownership upgrades** (today: console-only ⬆️; dialog says "0 new" after you buy 4 books)
- [ ] **2. Import summary counts ALL ownership promotions, labeled by destination** — "3 wishlist → owned", "1 wishlist → sample" — keyed on ownershipType transitions (today: onWishlist-flip only ⇒ misses sample→owned AND would mislabel wishlist→sample as owned). Also: name the titles in the console line (the 🎉-line-has-no-title gap that blocked diagnosis 2026-09-04).
- [ ] **3. Goals on promotion: KEEP (old rule stands — never silently destroy)** + receipt line; optional one-click "Clear goals on these N" in the import summary (Ron to pick during build). Rationale: promoted books already require a manual All-Books visit to file into reading lists, so clearing rides a trip he makes anyway (Ron 2026-09-04).
- [ ] **4. Import summary echoed into 🕐 toast history** (receipts gap: dialog evidence vanishes on refresh)
- [ ] **5. Un-trash on ownership upgrade** (buying a trashed book should resurrect it — Ron: "YES! Include it")
- [ ] **6. Known-ASIN walked records become UPDATE events, not dup-skip discards** ([fetcher:1422-1425](../amazon-library-fetcher.js) seeds seenASINs with all known ASINs; live sample record for wishlisted Oath of Honor was thrown away 2026-09-04) — refresh ownershipType/acquisitionDate/binding from the record; wishlist→sample/borrow becomes visible (today invisible FOREVER for borrows — no pastPurchase backstop); never downgrade purchased (stale sample records in full fetches); newest-record-wins = record date vs STORED acquisitionDate; respect userEdited; acquisitionDate refresh also heals the watermark re-walk quirk. pastPurchase upgrade demoted to backstop.
- [ ] **7. `TEMP_OWNERSHIP` gains `publicLibraryLending` + `audiblePlus`** (list written v4.11.8, never updated for v5.2.0's new types — loan→purchase can never upgrade; no-goal loans skipped by price phase)
- [ ] **8. Docs**: wishlist model + transition matrix into a design doc (FORMAT-POLICY sibling) — never relitigate. ~~Divider between Move to / Copy to~~ (suspect exonerated by item 9's diagnosis).
- [ ] **11. Action toasts name their targets** (NEXT UP — Ron 2026-09-08; the deferred half of "toasts name targets EVERYWHERE", split from the undo/redo pass with his blessing this time): single-target action toasts carry the book/folder/list name ("Hid 'Bitter Gold Hearts' (purchased — hides instead of deleting)"); bulk keep honest counts; explanatory clauses survive, naming adds to them. No chokepoint — scattered showToast calls — so the pass needs a systematic audit like alpha.5's (spot-fixes miss sites; sweeps with a checker don't). Ops-layer toasts (6.13.1) largely compliant already; the pass is for count-only stragglers.
- [ ] **9. Relay-import Inbox placement: predicate must be "in no folder", not "new to the books DB"** (DIAGNOSED 2026-09-04: Ron's whole library — Inbox count 3076 — got Inbox-copied when Relay Import ran as a restore against the deleted books store on Sep-3; every book was "new to the DB" while the folders blob still filed them; js:4770/4824. Fix: filter newBookIds through getAllBookIdsInFolders() + skip isDeleted). Add restore-into-empty-DB to PRELAUNCH-TEST-GATE suite 4. ~~One-shot cleanup~~ RESOLVED 2026-09-04: Ron restored the 9/3 13:05 backup; count script showed only 4 genuine dual-filed stragglers (hand-cleaned). Retest this path after the fix (books-blob delete + relay restore ⇒ Inbox count unchanged).

## 🚦 Pre-Launch (must-do before public launch)

**Docs & onboarding**
- [ ] **security.html: residual polish** (2026-09-09: content lies FIXED same-day + nav + theme via Tailwind-override sheet — dark/hc-dark done): remaining = hc-light treatment, and optionally a real restyle onto the site's shared CSS instead of utility-class overrides. Low priority now.
- [ ] USER-GUIDE.md + GPT manual — rewrite around the new mental model (All Books / Searches / Book Lists / Folders; custodial vs supplemental; "when to use which"), **including the Book List ↔ Folder workflow pattern** (structure lives in Folders; to-read queues live in Book Lists) and "get books out of Inbox → use a folder, not a Book List". Draw the backlog-wrangling examples from **docs/design/WORKFLOW-PATTERNS.md** (running collection of real usage patterns)
- [ ] **Rename user-facing "Relay" → "Cloud Sync"** (Cloud Sync Setup / Import from Cloud; status section, tooltips, fetcher overlays, recovery steps) — kills the engineering term that leaked into the UI; "Cloud Relay" considered and rejected as jargon-plus-clunk (2026-08-28). Internal names (`RWRelay`, filenames, worker) unchanged. Pure copy-pass, ~20-40 strings + README/features/tutorials. **Fold into the USER-GUIDE rewrite** so the new names bake into the docs in one motion. Renames are free pre-launch and expensive forever after.
- [ ] Sizzle reel — update the script for Book Lists/Searches, then record + produce
- [ ] Add "Watch Tutorials" to the app Help menu
- [ ] Refresh the landing-page before/after screenshot (post-redesign "after")
- [ ] FAQ page — faq.html (Security/Privacy, Data/Backup, Troubleshooting, Library, General); link from Help, README, features/tutorials footers
- [ ] Custom GPT support assistant — build + link from Help menu → see docs/design/SUPPORT-GPT.md (spec)
- [ ] Disaster Recovery documentation (relay credential recovery paths; backups include creds)

**Safety / data-integrity guards**
- [ ] **Test gate green** — the data-layer characterization suites in docs/design/PRELAUNCH-TEST-GATE.md (merge/edit-protection, import mapping, tombstones, load guards, relay semantics) exist and pass. Spec'd 2026-09-04 while the bug classes were fresh; ~2-4 sessions at gate time. Blocks launch, nothing else.
- [ ] Demo-whitelist footgun guard (6f) — warn/confirm before uploading a library dramatically smaller than the relay's; make the active-whitelist banner unmissable; ensure no demo state can ship
- [ ] "Rebuild library from Amazon (full re-fetch)" affordance (6g) — clear the relay library without DevTools; pairs with the demo-whitelist guard
- [ ] Pin remaining CDN deps (6h) — React/ReactDOM to an exact 18.x; audit all HTML entry points (Tailwind's durable fix is the precompile step below)
- [ ] `integrity-homeless` investigation — real user event in v6.11.5 + 2 more field events 2026-09-03; books in IndexedDB with no folder refs. F1 (7.7.0) removed the leading suspected cause (stale-FOLDERS_KEY cold boot referencing nothing for newest books) — WATCH the event post-release before investing a session
- [ ] **Mid-sweep challenge detection** — classify challenge-shaped responses (HTML where JSON expected, validate-captcha redirect, robot-check 503) in the fetchers' retry path and halt with an honest message: "Amazon is asking for a human check. Open any Amazon page, complete it, then re-run — everything fetched so far is safe." (That last clause is TRUE post-7.0: a halted run is uncommitted and invisible.) Phase 0 already guards startup; this covers a challenge appearing mid-run, which today reads as generic API errors. Never observed yet — cheap pre-launch hardening. (External review item 7 kernel.)

**Launch economics**
- [ ] Flip to Workers Paid ($5/mo) at or shortly before public launch — analysis DONE (RELAY-ECONOMICS.md, 2026-08-28): post-7.5.0 levers, flat $5 covers ~250 Ron-like users; free tier is ~6-10 and SHARED. This is now just the act of upgrading the Cloudflare plan at the right moment.

## 🔧 7.0.0 follow-ups (relay)

- [ ] **Checkpoint the cold (first-time) fetch** — a ~3,000-book initial enrichment has no resume; die at book 2,800, start over. 7.0 makes it natural: send enrichment progress as mailbox letters in stages so a resumed run's skip-hint already knows what's done. Bites each user exactly once — low priority, pre-launch nice-to-have. (From the 2026-08-21 external sync review, item 1's salvageable kernel.)

- [ ] **Worker/client protocol-constant drift note** — `LETTER_TTL` (worker, seconds) and `LETTER_TTL_MS` (client) are mirrored by hand; same for the minted-id format. Fine at 2 constants with cross-reference comments; revisit a shared protocol-constants module if a third appears. (Worker is the same language — JS — different runtime; sharing is possible, low value today.)

## 💰 Price sweep scoping + staleness display (agreed 2026-08-21, from external sync review item 2)

- [ ] **Format watch (LOW priority)** — `formatWatch: 'kindle'` on print-edition placeholders; slow-lane detection of a Kindle edition appearing; on hit, OFFER (never auto) a swap to the new ASIN carrying folder/Book List/tags/price goal (cousin of the wishlist→owned upgrade). KEY VERIFY first: does the batch enrichment API expose sibling editions for a print ASIN, or does detection need per-book product-page fetches? LOW because the live cases are mostly covered: Amazon author-follow notifies on new-format releases (Heinlein), and for withdrawn-Kindle books already recorded as Kindle, the price REAPPEARING in the normal price sweep is itself the availability signal (The Destroyer's 18 withdrawn titles) — the only uncovered gap is print-placeholder→Kindle detection. (External review item 6.)
- [ ] **Optional "slow lane": occasional re-enrichment of buyable books** (ratings/review counts — frozen at first fetch today, which is fine for owned books but mildly stale for purchase decisions). Monthly-ish or every-Nth-fetch, reusing item-2's scoped list + batch calls. 7.0 letters make it interruption-safe: results go out as a run; tab closes, so be it — nothing torn, resumes next time. NOT the per-book adaptive-TTL machinery from the external review (a beautiful solution to a scale problem we don't have). Likely shared mechanism with the format watch above. (External review item 3 kernel.)

## 🔜 Next (6.12.x follow-ups)

- [ ] **Operations single-source-of-truth — remaining bits** — CORE shipped in **6.13.1**: folder delete (`deleteFolder`), book move/copy (all menu + drag → `moveItems`), folder reparent (menu/cut-paste/drag → `reparentFolder`), Book List create/delete, and forced undo/redo toasts (every action stamped with a label). Still un-consolidated (lower priority, less drift-prone): **tag** delete, **Search** delete, folder/Book-List **rename** (make undoable), the folder-copy **redo** TODO (js~6398, in `COPY_PASTE_FOLDER`), and optionally folding `moveItems`' folder-reparent into `reparentFolder`. → docs/design/OPERATIONS-REFACTOR.md. Feeds MODULE-SPLIT.
- [ ] **DEL deletes the folder(s) selected in the right-pane list / Folders overview** — today the DEL key only deletes the folder you're *inside* (`selectedFolderId`), not a right-pane row selection (`getSelectedFolderIds()`). Wire single-select via `deleteFolder`, multi-select via a batch confirm + one compound undo (best once the ops layer has a `deleteFolders(folders)` primitive — don't ship single-only, it's more confusing than neither). Surfaced during ops refactor #1.


- [ ] **Legacy FOLDERS_KEY/BOOKLISTS_KEY migration reads: KEEP INDEFINITELY** (Ron 2026-09-04: field users update on their own schedule — GoatCounter shows real users; the reads are cheap and dated comments explain them). Revisit only with adoption evidence, never on a release-count schedule.
- [ ] **Multi-tab hardening — Web-Locks read-only second tab** + reload-then-promote + live/freeze viewer → designed in docs/design/MULTI-INSTANCE.md §4. NEXT in the agreed queue after 7.7.0 lands.

**Auto-Organize ergonomics:**
- [ ] **Book List right-click menu — drop Move/Copy + block Book-List→folder drag (A)** — a Book List entry is a shortcut; Move/Copy of a shortcut INTO a folder is incoherent. When viewing a Book List, remove those two menu items (keep Add-to-Book-List, Remove-from-list, Edit, reorder); block plain AND Ctrl drag from a Book List onto a folder. (Ron, 2026-08-08 — the muddled Book-List→Inbox "move" that created the Inbox+folder+list triple-membership mess.)
- [ ] **Undo stack clears mid-session unexpectedly (D)** — twice (2026-08-07/08) the undo stack emptied with no user undo/redo. **NARROWED 2026-09-01, not solved**: the sweep proved NO code path clears the stack (in-memory only; MAX_UNDO trims oldest only) — so SOME invisible reload is the only mechanism on the table. Candidates: TinySuspender discard-and-restore (a reload the user never sees) — but Ron's config argues against it for those incidents (60-min idle timeout, he was actively bouncing tabs; localhost/rw.com NOT whitelisted, so possible but improbable) — or a forgotten manual reload. Watch: next sighting, check console history + Data Status "last checked" (a discard clears both). PROPHYLACTIC regardless: whitelist localhost + readerwrangler.com in TinySuspender (a suspended RW tab also risks torn flush-on-leave pushes — swept now, but still wasteful).

**2026-08-10 library-cleanup findings (Ron):**
- [ ] **Auto-Organize preview should show Book List membership** too (alongside the folder neighborhood).
- [ ] **"Other books by this author" quick-view** — from a book/folder, see the author's other books without jumping to All Books + filter + back.
- [ ] **Right-click "Open" a book while multi-selecting** — opens the book detail WITHOUT clearing the selection; normal flow opens the whole selection as a shelf (nav). Lets you ID a book mid-scan and resume. (Name per UX.)
- [ ] **USER-GUIDE/GPT note: "can't filter by field X" → tell them the workaround** (e.g. List view → add that column → sort). More than one way to skin a cat.
- [ ] **Cross-section drag: Folders ↔ Book Lists** (DECIDED 2026-08-29) — honesty fixes (Added-not-Moved toast/undo from list views; kill fake drop affordances incl. the blanket left-pane preventDefault; undoable list reorder; toast over-count; Trash leak) + the two gestures: folder **ON** a list row = add its books; folder/books **BETWEEN** rows = create new list(s) there, named `<folder name> - To Read` for folders / engine-named for books (grabbed-noun principle, Beach-Reads example); right-click New gains current-folder-name fallback → docs/design/CROSS-SECTION-DRAG.md (spec)
- [ ] **Search everywhere — scope toggle + zero-result nudge** (Ron, 2026-08-29) — answers "is this book in my library?" WITHOUT losing your spot. Search box stays folder-scoped by default; while searching, show a scope toggle **This folder | Everywhere** (Finder/Explorer search-in-place convention). "Everywhere" shows all-library matches in the right pane as a temporary view (reuse the view-folder filter-stash plumbing); clearing the search returns to the folder + scroll position untouched. **Discoverability engine**: the empty-result state offers *"No matches in ‹folder› — Search everywhere?"* as a one-click link (Gmail/Amazon convention). Result rows pair with the existing "see where a book lives" popup — the answer arrives with locations.

- [ ] **Terminology copy pass** (6.12.1) — "shortcut" language in Book List toasts/menus; explain "Linked Copies" once in manual/GPT → see docs/design/TERMINOLOGY.md (spec)
- [ ] **Author/Series whitespace hygiene** — collapse runs of internal whitespace + trim on fetch/import/edit so "Jodi  Taylor" (double space) can't split from "Jodi Taylor" (silently creates a duplicate author + orphan series in Auto-Organize). Add a **one-time cleanup sweep** for existing data. (Ron hit this on Jodi Taylor / Time Police — 2 of 7 books mis-authored, series looked incomplete in the Auto-Organize preview.)
- [ ] **Fetcher `ee6d83c` re-apply** on v4.11.10 — `LIBRARY_EXCLUDE_TAGS` named-constant/doc + delisted-book (`product=null`) count+notice adapted to coexist with null-product recovery (count only when recovery also fails)
- [ ] **Returned / expired borrows — filter & hide** — Prime/KU/library loans that were returned still clutter the library. Fetcher flags borrow nodes with `activeBorrow === false`; app adds a **"Returned" ownership filter, hidden-by-default** (toggle to show), bulk move-to-folder for keepers. **NOT** via the ASIN exclusion list (would block re-borrows). → docs/design/RETURNED-BORROWS.md
- [ ] **Book Lists management view** + generic orderable-left-pane-section ordering (Folders/Views/Book Lists uniform) → see docs/design/FOLDER-ORDERING.md (spec)
- [ ] Delete from All Books — soft-delete to Trash, removing from ALL folders + Book Lists at once (reuse membership snapshot; confirm dialog discloses count)
- [ ] Rectangle/Lasso selection in cover view (extends `explorerSelectedItems`)
- [ ] **Hidden books: 3-state control** (ratified 2026-09-03) — Show Hidden is a visibility toggle, not a finder ("find the 2 hidden among 337" is impractical). Hide hidden / Show all / **Only hidden** — the third state answers "what have I hidden?"
- [ ] **Fetcher: discrepancy-accounting redesign** (spec'd via live investigation 2026-09-03; supersedes the count-triggered sweep). THE INVARIANT the design must be able to report: Ron's library matches Amazon EXACTLY — 2801 = 2801 unique owned ASINs — once the units are right. Rules: (1) compare UNIQUE-ASIN SETS only, same filtered universe both sides — RW side excludes wishlist (337); Amazon side deduped (Amazon's `totalCount` counts acquisition RECORDS, not titles: 15 sample-then-purchase pairs in Ron's data; use totalCount only as a progress estimate). (2) KEEP Amazon's stock NOT-hash filters everywhere — probed live: hash `858f501de…` tags exactly the 13 product-null husks (unfetchable dead records, likely deleted-sample corpses), hash `222711ade…` currently tags nothing; the maps/physical items are NOT filter-hidden (present in the filtered walk). Log the filtered-vs-unfiltered count delta each fetch (13 today) as a reclassification tripwire. (3) Retire the 🩹 count sweep (its trigger compared titles+wishlist against records — structurally never equal); replace with set-exact differences in the orphan scan: amazon − local = missing owned books → refetch by ASIN → small follow-up run write; local − amazon = orphan CANDIDATES → verify absence before flagging (re-check just the candidate set). (4) User-facing output = Ron's two-directional "Removed-books check" report (each direction suppressed at 0; "orphan" jargon out; ℹ️ notes "still safe in ReaderWrangler"); the success line "Your library matches Amazon exactly" is now actually achievable. Exonerated by the investigation: API pagination (30- and 50-page walks returned identical complete sets; 101 tie-timestamp clusters covering 279 books, harmless), Amazon deletions (zero). The false-orphan bug itself (BOOK_BINDINGS skip inside the verification loop) is fixed separately in fetcher v5.2.7.
- [ ] Fetcher follow-ups: ownership-**upgrade** live positive test; un-trash on ownership upgrade (storage.js); fix the "772%" enriched ratio; elapsed-time display frozen during "Checking Relay" (both lines) / "Recovering" phases (timer repaints only on phase/progress updates — Ron 2026-09-03 ×2); **minimum request throttle floor** (~400ms) — FETCH_DELAY_MS is 0 today because network RTT throttles naturally, but if Amazon's backend ever speeds up we'd hammer them; Ron recalled this decision 2026-09-04 and it was never recorded — now it is
- [ ] Book detail dialog tooltips (esp. Collections = read-only-from-Amazon)
- [ ] Wishlist fetcher — capture real binding on add (product-page `bindingInformation`), not only after enrichment
- [ ] Metadata import (paste-list / CSV) + matching → see docs/design/Metadata-Import.md

- [ ] Comma-separated series-position multi-edit ("2, 4" mapped to selected books in display order) — **needed for David Drake / Raj Whitehall** (ownership gaps that "renumber by current order" can't handle)
- [ ] **Omnibus / multi-volume series position (B)** — a single book that IS volumes 1–3 wants a range/multi position (`1-3` or `1,2,3`) on ONE record. Distinct from the comma-separated multi-edit above (which spreads a sequence across MANY books). Needs a data-model decision: `seriesPosition` is a single value today ("1-3" would sort as 1, display as text). Consider a `seriesPositionEnd` or a positions array + sort/display/number-by-order handling. (Ron, 2026-08-09.)
- [ ] Folder "Move to Top / Move to Bottom" context items (D)
- [ ] Fix drag-subfolder→root drop-position (**confirmed still broken 2026-08-03**, annoying) — dropping a subfolder at root lands it alphabetical-ish near the bottom instead of at the drop target; shares a root cause with new-folder alphabetical insert + Move-to stale position
- [ ] Book Lists: **"Arrange by series #"** — in Manual mode, bake the series-number order into the list's manual order (persistent, then hand-tweak). The Book-List analog of folder sort-then-bake; a one-time rearrange, not a live sort mode. (Distinct from the existing "Number by current order," which sets each book's *position value*, not the list's order.)
- [ ] **Left-pane jump-to-top/bottom placement** — both chevrons now ship, but they sit at the **bottom-left**, not at the two **scrollbar ends** as originally intended (Ron expected top-at-top / bottom-at-bottom). Scroll affordances conventionally live by the scrollbar (right). Reconsider: move the pair to the right near the scrollbar (spatial mapping), or adopt the single context-aware "back to top" that appears on scroll-down. **Per-section jump** (Searches / Book Lists / Folders): skip — the collapsible sections already handle that navigation.
