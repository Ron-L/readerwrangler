# Workflow Patterns — wrangling a reading backlog

_A running collection of **real ways people use RW's flexibility**, captured as they emerge. This is source
material for the eventual USER-GUIDE / support-GPT — framed as **"here are patterns and trade-offs,"** not
step-by-step how-to. There's rarely one right way; the point is to show the building blocks and let users
compose their own. Started 2026-08-06 from Ron's own backlog method._

## The foundation: two organizing primitives, two jobs

Everything below rests on RW's core split:

- **Folders = custodial.** A folder is a book's *home* — where it lives. Homes should be **stable**: set once, rarely moved. Browsing a folder should always tell the truth about what's in it.
- **Book Lists = supplemental.** A list is a *lens / overlay* — a hand-picked set of shortcuts. Adding or removing a book from a list never tags, moves, hides, or deletes the book. Lists are cheap to add to and cheap to clear.

The single most useful habit that falls out of this: **let folders hold *where a book belongs*, and let Book Lists (or tags) hold *transient status* like "still to read."** Status changes often; homes shouldn't.

## Pattern: a "to read" queue that doesn't disturb your shelves

Goal: track what you still have to read, *without* your folder structure going into flux every time you finish a book.

**Principle:** the book's folder home is decided once; "unread" lives on a **Book List** you *delete from* when done. Same shape whether the author has 40 books or 1 — which keeps it a single habit.

### Prolific authors → a per-author queue
When you own many books by an author:
1. Right-click a book → **Auto-Organize ▸ By Series** (or By Author) — it files **all** of that author's unfiled books into `Author / Series` folders (their permanent home). *(Auto-Organize acts on every unfiled book by that author, ignoring any Inbox filter you have active — so read and unread alike get filed.)*
2. In the preview, select just the **unread** covers and **right-click → Add to Book List → `<Author> - To Read`**.
3. Confirm → the books land in their series folders **and** stay on the `<Author> - To Read` list as shortcuts.
4. Finish one → **delete it from the list**. It stays filed where it belongs; the list shrinks to what's left.

The list is the queue; the folder is the home. (Ron runs many of these, e.g. *Dungeon Crawler Carl - To Read*, *Kirov Series To Read*, *Neal Stephenson - To Read*.)

### One-off / few-book authors → the same shape, one shared queue
Two viable approaches — the first keeps the model clean, the second trades that for visual browsing:

**(Recommended) Home now, queue on a list.**
- Move the book to its permanent home (typically a catch-all like **Various Authors**), and add it to a shared **New To Read** Book List.
- Finish it → just **delete it from the list**. Nothing moves; **Various Authors** always contains every one-off, read or not.
- Slice the queue by *kind* with **tags** (e.g. `Comics`, `Classics`, `Time Travel`) and filter the list.
- Why this one: it's the *same* list-as-queue habit as the prolific-author method (one mental model), post-read work is a single delete, and your folders never lie about what they hold.

**(Alternative) Queue as a folder tree.**
- Park the book under a **New To Read** folder (with subfolders by type: *Classics, Comics, Non-Fiction, Time Travel, Anthologies…*).
- Finish it → **move** it to its real home (e.g. Various Authors).
- Why you might: the subfolders let you *browse* the backlog by type in the tree (no filtering), which can help decide what to read next by mood.
- Costs: post-read is a *move* not a delete; while queued the book is *absent* from its real home (that folder is incomplete until you re-home it); and "forgot to move it" leaves clutter.

**Tags vs subfolders for slicing** is the real fork between the two: tags overlay type without touching homes (fits the recommended approach); subfolders make the folder tree carry both *home-ness* and *queue-state*, which is browsable but muddies the "folder = stable home" idea.

## Pattern: reading status via Amazon collections + Saved Searches

Ron drives "have I read this?" off an Amazon **Collection** plus **Saved Searches**:
- A Kindle collection named **Read** (past tense) holds finished books.
- **Saved Search "Read"** = in that collection; **Saved Search "Uncollected"** = *not* in it (i.e. the candidates still to deal with).
- Filtering the Inbox by **Uncollected** surfaces the not-yet-processed books to organize.

Naming convention worth adopting in docs: **"Read"** = past tense (finished); **"To Read"** = imperative/future (the queue). Keeps list names unambiguous.

Caveat the workflow tolerates: the Amazon collection isn't perfect — you might have read something that's still Uncollected. Because you *hand-pick* which books go on a `To Read` list (rather than auto-adding all Uncollected), you naturally skip the ones you've actually finished.

_(Historical note: tags were once considered for "next reads" — still perfectly viable for users who prefer tag-driven status over lists.)_

## Pattern: homing before owning — wishlist books & samples (2026-09-04)

- **Wishlist books get their *future* home immediately** (author/topic folder): the fetcher's
  wishlist→owned upgrade keeps folder/tags/price goal, so purchase day is zero work — and series folders
  honestly show ownership gaps. Wishlist *visibility* is a Saved Search (Ownership = Wishlist); never a
  folder or a hand-maintained list (it's self-maintaining data). A curated **Buy Next** list is the one
  legit hand-picked overlay.
- **Samples split by intent**: probably-buying → home like a wishlist book (sample→purchase upgrades in
  place, same ASIN); genuine audition → stays in the **Inbox** (a pending decision is what the Inbox is
  for) until the verdict.
- **Rejected samples**: delete on Amazon → RW orphan-flags it on the next fetch (RW never silently drops) →
  the periodic **🔍 Orphan filter sweep** finds them; delete → Empty Trash tombstones them for good. The
  flag does the remembering.

## Pattern: correcting ownership — override, don't delete (2026-09-10)

Live case: a series book showed as **Sample** when the user wanted it tracked as **Wishlist**
(the whole series had been added to the Amazon wishlist). Deleting the book, emptying Trash,
and re-importing brought it back as Sample.

- **Never delete to correct ownership.** Delete means "I don't want this record." A sample
  lives in your Amazon content library *permanently*, so every fresh fetch (dated after the
  delete) legitimately revives it — "Amazon still reports this" beats a tombstone by design.
  Delete-and-hope is unwinnable against a fact Amazon keeps asserting.
- **The Ownership dropdown is the front door, not a backdoor**: book dialog → Edit →
  Ownership → **Wishlist** (or Owned) → Save. This is one of the two legal manual transitions
  (OWNERSHIP-MODEL.md), it's **protected from fetch overwrite** (marked user-edited), and
  Amazon's original value is snapshotted behind a **Reset** option in the same dropdown.
- The mental model that makes this click: RW separates **Amazon's facts** (you hold a sample)
  from **your states** (you want this book). The override changes your state while RW keeps
  knowing the truth underneath — it's the mechanism *designed* for "Amazon's label isn't my
  truth."
- _Interim caveat (until ownership-honesty batch item 6 lands): the fetchers currently discard
  walked records for already-known ASINs, so a wishlist walk won't auto-update a known sample
  book. Item 6 turns those into update events; until then the manual override is the answer._

**The truth path (when the fact itself is removable).** The override records *your state* over
Amazon's fact — fine for facts you can't remove (a book you own). But an unwanted sample is a
fact you CAN delete, and removing it at the source keeps everything literally true (Ron's
standard, 2026-09-10: "the override is a lie — it's still a sample on my Kindle"):

1. **Amazon**: delete the sample (Manage Your Content) — and add the book/series to the
   wishlist in the same visit if that's the goal.
2. **Library fetch → import**: any normal fetch works — the fetcher's Phase 5 **orphan scan is
   always a full-library pass**, run automatically at the end of every fetch. Just **don't close
   the tab early**: the scan runs after "fetch complete" with its own progress bar; let it
   finish, then import. The book comes back orphan-flagged (🔍 filter finds it).
3. **RW**: delete the flagged book, **Empty Trash** (tombstone). The ASIN is now unknown.
4. **Wishlist fetch → import**: the record isn't dup-skipped any more (ASIN unknown), lands as
   genuine wishlist, dated after the tombstone → revives as wishlist. True end to end.

_Ordering constraint (until item 6): step 3 must sit BETWEEN the two fetches — a wishlist walk
while the sample is still a known book gets discarded as a duplicate. Amazon-side actions batch
into one visit; RW needs two import rounds. Item 6 collapses this to one pass._

_Validated live 2026-09-10 (Ron, the original case): sequence worked exactly as written._

**Relay timing (support note):** an import racing right behind a fetcher push can miss it —
relay storage propagates with eventual consistency ("additions take ~a minute to arrive",
PM v7.0.0). If a just-fetched book doesn't appear, wait a minute and import again. Not a bug.

**Why series end up mixed in the first place:** usually *historical accretion*, not
inconsistency-as-error — e.g. book #4 sampled before adopting RW, #5–6 added later via the
series-wishlist habit. The fix is one-time normalization (this pattern, or the override),
then keeping a single habit going forward: **series wishlist-add for wanted-but-unowned books**.

## Pattern: Book Lists as mobile filters (2026-09-10)

Mobile can browse but not filter — so **do the filtering on desktop and freeze the results into
Book Lists**, which mirror to the phone (order included, per the 7.6.0 mobile honesty suite).
Ron's working set: `New To Read - Prime`, `- Sample`, `- Wishlist`, `- Time Travel`,
`- Systemized Magic`… — each is a desktop filter pass (by ownership, tag, etc.) sorted into a
list, then consumed from the phone. The Prime list doubles as a priority queue: clearing read
Primes frees loan slots for new ones.

Structural takeaway for the sidebar: this splits Book Lists into two tiers — a handful of
**work lists** (filter surrogates, priority-ordered, touched daily) and a long alphabetical
tail of **per-series To-Read queues** (hunted occasionally by name). Sidebar ordering features
(pins, name-sort) should serve exactly that split.

## Meta
- **There's no single right way** — these are compositions of the same primitives (folders, Book Lists, tags, saved searches, Auto-Organize). The guide should present them as menus of trade-offs, not mandates.
- Add new patterns here as they surface, then distill for the USER-GUIDE near launch.
