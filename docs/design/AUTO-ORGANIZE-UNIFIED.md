# Auto-Organize Unified — one view, selection is the scope

_Designed 2026-09-08 (Ron + UX review, aligned before any code). Supersedes the mode split of
AUTO-ORGANIZE-SCOPE.md (its safety principle survives as the DEFAULT, see §4); builds on
AUTO-ORGANIZE-RIGHTCLICK.md and the 6.16/6.17 preview. Priority: jumped ahead of the
ownership-honesty batch items 1-9/11 — live daily pain during Ron's queue-folder dissolution,
and the soak doubles as the test rig._

## 1. The problem (origin story, worth keeping)

The dialog had two modes — This folder ↔ Everywhere — switched by a six-pixel toggle. Three weeks
after co-designing it, its own designer, mid-dissolution, stared at a This-folder preview that
DISPLAYED the Inbox books it could act on and concluded the capability didn't exist ("it won't
offer to auto-organize those in Inbox... by design"), then invented the Everywhere mode from
scratch as a feature request. The third invisible-control finding in one week (disguised ownership
pill, dead-feeling Ctrl+Z, now this). Additionally the two modes render the same books in
different order and emphasis; This-folder's origin-trays group by where books happen to sit
(noise) instead of where they're going (the point); and This-folder cannot sanely render
multi-folder membership.

## 2. The unified model

**Scope is a property of the SELECTION, not a mode.** One view, one working set:

- **Layout = the Everywhere layout** (destination-grouped: author → series groups → covers),
  which both parties judged clearer. Origin never regroups anything.
- **Everything by the target authors is visible**: current-folder books, strays from other
  folders/Inbox, and already-home books. Nothing actable is hidden — the discoverability fix is
  structural, not a better toggle.
- **Initial check-state = the current folder's books + the Inbox strays** (amended 2026-09-08
  during alpha.1 soak, Ron: the Inbox books are why the dialog was opened — symmetric with the
  §4 removal defaults). Ctrl+A (plus a visible **Select all** button at the TOP — selection is
  where scanning starts, the footer confirms) checks everything; group checkboxes select their
  trays; Shift+click ranges follow VISUAL order.
- **The one selection drives BOTH actions** (extends the 6.16.0 principle): right-click → Add to
  Book List acts on it, and the footer button organizes it.
- The This-folder/Everywhere toggle is deleted. The Consolidate title/verb is retired (§6).
- Entry points unchanged (right-click a folder / All Books); from All Books the "current folder"
  contribution to defaults is simply empty.

## 3. Three-level checkbox hierarchy (Ron's design)

Same semantics at every level — a checkbox checks everything beneath it:

| Level | Control | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| Series/group | group checkbox | all its books |
| Book | cover check | all its removable sources (per §4 defaults) |
| Source | the origin popup | individual folder memberships |

- **Origin caption**: under **every foldered mover** (amended 2026-09-08: originally strays-only,
  but a caption's absence is itself an invisible encoding, and mixed shelves read as a rendering
  bug — entry-folder books get their caption too, confirming placement at a glance). One small
  gray line: the folder name, or `N places · M stay` for multi-source. The caption anchors the
  popup and, after an override, shows the NET effect in words. **Words, not glyphs** (a ✂ was
  field-misread as "%<" during design).
- **Origin popup**: hover/click the caption → the book's folders, each with a checkbox (checked =
  remove when organizing). Reuses the 6.13.2 cursor-corner/hover-intent popup machinery — proven,
  no new hover behavior.

## 4. Removal defaults (the de-organize guard, generalized)

Checking a book means: **ensure home membership + remove from the CURRENT folder and the Inbox.
Every other membership is KEPT by default** — the popup is the override.

Why: the current folder is definitionally the mess being cleaned; the Inbox is never a home
(organizing-principles doctrine); every other folder is a potential deliberate dual-home
(Non-Fiction + author folder), and silently stripping those is the de-organize disaster class
AUTO-ORGANIZE-SCOPE existed to prevent — its principle survives here as the default rather than a
hard scope boundary. The rule self-corrects across dissolution passes: membership in another
queue-folder survives today and gets cleaned when the user runs AO from THAT folder. From All
Books: Inbox-only removal + gather. If a kept membership is wrong, one popup click cuts it.

## 5. Already-home books

Shown **small + grayed** with their group ("already here"), **selectable** — so Book-List ops can
include them — and a **no-op on commit**. This subsumes the old three-state trays and answers
"what's already in the target?" in place.

## 6. Button honesty

The button counts **actual movers, never the selection**: `Organize 4 books`, with the footer
caption reconciling: "6 selected — 4 will move, 2 already home." The verb is **Organize**
everywhere; "Consolidate N books" dies with the mode that named it.

## 7. Edge cases (settled)

- Series-A book sitting in series-B's folder, or loose in the author root when it belongs in a
  series subfolder: simply *not home* → normal full-size mover. No special case.
- Multi-copy rendering: books are single entities with N memberships — one cover, one caption,
  popup for the rest. (This-folder mode would have multiplied covers; unified view can't.)
- The 6.17.0 per-(folder,book) copy-pick machinery becomes the popup's state model.

## 8. Engine + migration notes

- `organizeEngine` gains per-book removal sets (folderIds to remove from) in place of the
  mode-driven `sourceFolderId`/`consolidateRemovals` split; existing subtree-exclusion and
  wouldDeOrganize guards unchanged.
- 7.7.1's grouped Already-filed layout is absorbed into §5's already-home rendering.
- Batch item 12 (This-folder multi-select repair) is MOOT — that view is deleted. The
  visual-order range-select fix lands here instead (§2).
- Undo: stays ONE `WIZARD_ORGANIZE` compound (positional restore incl. removed memberships),
  label per UNDO-MODEL naming ("Organized 6 books for Wesley Chu").

## 9. Retargeting — "File under…" (designed 2026-09-08, second session)

The dialog is, in Ron's framing, *the organization filtered to these authors (hide-empty) plus
suggested moves*. Corrections therefore need full move power — delivered through ONE consistent
control, not free drag: a **"File under…" menu** on any group header, any selection, any single
book — **including already-home books**. Targets:

1. any other **group** in the preview,
2. any **existing folder** (picker),
3. **➕ New folder…** (named in place — covers "create `Niven, Pournelle` when AO proposed
   filing the co-authored books under plain `Niven`", and first-ever authors),
4. **Inbox** (demote a mis-filed book back out, even from a real author folder).

The canonical case (Ron's live one): AO proposes group "Larry Niven, Jerry Pournelle, Steven
Barnes" — he collects the duo but not Barnes solo → File under… → existing folder "Larry Niven,
Jerry Pournelle". One click, whole group.

**Author strings are NEVER parsed** (standing rule, ratified 6.17.0-era, re-confirmed 2026-09-08):
grouping is the whole trimmed/lowercased string — a comma in a folder name means the *string*
contains a comma, not that anything was split. Correction is human, per case, via this menu.

**Persistent aliases: REJECTED (2026-09-08).** "Always file 'A, B' under A" was proposed and
withdrawn — a stored rule that fires invisibly, with no surface to see or delete it, silently
misfiles the day "Niven, Pournelle, Chu" appears. It is the same disease as the invisible Reset
flag and the six-pixel scope toggle. Case-by-case retargeting suffices because filed books don't
re-propose — only NEW arrivals of a compound string need the click. If repetition ever genuinely
bites, an alias may return ONLY with a visible manager + an in-dialog "aliased → X (change)"
badge at the point of effect. Free drag between groups: stretch goal, menu first.

Supersedes AUTO-ORGANIZE-COAUTHORS.md's chosen design (author-string parsing + filedAuthors —
both dead; its problem statement and threshold-undercount analysis remain as history).

## 10. Test plan sketch (at build time, precise values per Rule 4)

Wesley Chu fixture (Ron's live case): Wishlist folder = 1 book, Inbox strays = 5, expect: dialog
opens with 1 checked / 5 visible-unchecked with `⌂ Inbox` captions; Select all → button reads
`Organize 6 books`; commit → all six under their series homes, Inbox memberships gone, Wishlist
folder emptied of them; one Ctrl+Z restores every membership.
