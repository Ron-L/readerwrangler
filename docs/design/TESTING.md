# Testing — the regression library, and how it grows

_Decided 2026-11-04 (Ron + Claude). The umbrella over every test in ReaderWrangler: what kinds there are, when each
runs, how the library grows task by task, and the rules that keep it trustworthy. Supersedes the "out of scope —
permanently" line of PRELAUNCH-TEST-GATE.md for screens, dialogs, drag-and-drop and menus: the browser driver makes
them testable, and with Claude writing the tests the cost that justified skipping them is gone. That doc's suites stay
the pre-launch data gate (task "All the pre-launch data tests pass")._

---

## 1. The rule

> **"If you don't have a test case, you can't prove you fixed it."** — Ron

The regression library is built **gradually, from the work** — never written all up front. Each task adds the tests
that prove it; each bug fix adds the test that would have caught it. Over time the library becomes the guarantee that
nothing that once worked silently stops working.

**When a test covers one case of a class** (one ownership kind, one filter), **it covers the whole class if that's
cheap** — one test with a row per case, the rows taken from **the same list the code uses**, so a new case is tested
the day it's added. Each row needs its expected result; **a case with no expected result written fails the test**
(a default "missing — write its expectation" failure), so nobody can add an ownership kind or a filter without saying
how it should behave. (Ron + Claude, 2026-11-04 — the fetcher's hand-kept list once missed library loans and Audible
Plus for exactly want of this.)

## 2. Two levels — test at the lowest one that can catch the problem

1. **Function tests** — fast, sturdy, most of the library. For logic: merging, the book-field table, the ownership
   rules, date labels, the key format and its check characters, Auto-Organize, the overlay stack. Plain Node files in
   `test/` (the five that exist today).
2. **Screen tests** — through the browser driver (Playwright for Python, the installed Chrome — Ron's browser — a throwaway profile, scrollbars shown).
   Only for what only the screen can show: what the Delete key targets, focus staying inside a window, drag labels,
   two tabs catching up, a menu item disabled rather than missing.

A bug in a function caught by a screen test costs a hundred times the runtime and breaks whenever a button moves. When
a screen test is the only way to catch something, consider first whether the logic should be lifted into a function
that a function test can reach.

**Free with every screen test:** the logging module ("One logging module…") is switched on in the
driver's browser, so **any unexpected error fails the run** — every screen test also checks "nothing went wrong
underneath".

## 3. Tiers — when each runs

| Tier | What | When | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | Function tests + the commit checks (names, parse, versions, private values, TOC…) | **Every commit, automatically** — only the tests covering the staged files | seconds (≤ ~10 s) |
| **2** | Screen tests | **Before every alpha Claude hands Ron** — Ron is never the first to find a regression | a few minutes (≤ ~5 min) |
| **3** | Relay tests (a local relay; dev only as a final check) | When relay code changes; before any worker deploy | ~1 min |
| **all** | Every tier | **Before every release** (release checklist step) | |

Plus a short **manual list per release** (§8) for what can't be automated.

## 4. The library — layout, IDs, tags, the runner

- **Files:** `test/*.test.js` (function, Node), `test/ui/test_*.py` (screen, Playwright for Python), `relay/test-*.mjs`
  (relay). Shared fixtures in `test/fixtures/`.
- **Every test has a stable ID** in its name — `AREA-NNN` (e.g. `MERGE-012`, `DELKEY-003`, `TABS-001`): failures,
  TODO tasks and post-mortems can name a test, and an ID never changes when its wording does.
- **Every test file declares, in its header:**
  - `tags:` — its areas (e.g. `merge, import`) and its tier;
  - `covers:` — the source files it tests (e.g. `bookMerge.js, storage.js`).
  The `covers:` lines are the **one source** for "which tests does this change need?" — tier 1 picks its tests from
  them, and nothing else keeps a separate list.
- **The runner — one command, in Python** (`tools/run_tests.py`; Ron's scripts rule): `--tier 1|2|3|all`,
  `--tag <area>`, `--id <ID>`, `--changed` (the tests covering what changed). One summary at the end; a screen test's
  failure saves a screenshot and the console to Claude's scratch folder. The commit hook calls it with `--changed`.
- **The project's own Python for screen tests** (Ron, 2026-11-04): Playwright lives in a venv at the repo root
  (`.venv/`, ignored by git), pinned in `requirements-dev.txt` — set up once with `py -m venv .venv` then
  `.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`. The runner starts tier-2 files with that Python and fails loud
  with that command if it's missing; tier 1 and the commit hook need no venv. Playwright drives the **installed Chrome**
  (`channel="chrome"`; Edge until 2026-11-06 — `RW_BROWSER=msedge` still runs it), so no browser download. Scrollbars are
  shown (Playwright hides them in a hidden browser by default, which hid a covered scrollbar); `App(zoom=, size=)`
  emulates browser zoom and window size. Claude's ad-hoc looks use Playwright's command-line tool through
  `npx @playwright/cli@<exact version>` — nothing installed system-wide.

## 5. Test data — three kinds

1. **A small, frozen, made-up library** (`test/fixtures/`, committed — no personal data). Built **on purpose to hold
   the awkward cases**: an omnibus at several positions, a sample and a loan of a wishlisted book, books in the Trash,
   deep and pinned folders, a book in no folder, a Book List with repeats, Amazon tags and your own tags, a book with no
   description. **Exact checks run against this.** It grows as tests need new cases.
2. **The demo library** (`readerwrangler-demo-library-ORGANIZED.json`, 118 books, and its unorganized twin with 119 —
   already public, keys removed by Ron on purpose): real Amazon-shaped data at a realistic small size — for tests that
   need believable books without the awkward cases spelled out.
3. **Ron's real library at scale** — `large-sample-private.json.gz` in the **private** repo's `test/` folder
   (3,270 books, from his 2026-11-04 backup; Cloud Sync Key removed and verified; compressed). For scale and speed —
   load time, drag with thousands of covers, "does it hold up" — not exact answers. **Committed in the private repo so
   it's backed up** (Ron): a test tied to that exact data set can always get it back, and made-up sets holding anything
   personal live there too (its README has the rules). The test loader refuses any file that still carries a key.

Screen tests never use Amazon's pages and never the real library's cloud copy: the test app has no Cloud Sync (or a
throwaway test channel on a local relay). Whatever the driver shows Claude goes to Anthropic — so the demo-style
fixture, never anything sensitive on screen.

## 6. The per-task routine

1. **A bug fix starts with a failing test** that reproduces the bug — then the fix makes it pass. (The utilities
   project's Law 18: reproduce with real input before explaining.)
2. **A feature's tests are its acceptance criteria**, written with it — the task's "What you'd get" made checkable.
   **A test that passes on its very first run is shown it can fail** — feed its check a deliberate problem (a wrong
   expected value, an injected error) and see it refuse — or it may be checking nothing (2026-11-04: APP-001–004's
   detectors were each shown a wrong count, a console error, a relay request and a crash).
3. **At the task's end:**
   - **promote** its tests into the library (almost always — a test that passed once costs nothing to keep); a test
     left out says why;
   - **gaps** found next to it (things the task touched that nothing tests) — **finish the class** while you're in the
     area if it's cheap (the question is "are the remaining rows cheap now?", not a percentage); **file it as a TODO**
     if it's its own project (new fixtures, real time).
4. **The mechanisms (not memory):**
   - each task in work gets a short **Tests** section — the IDs it added, and gaps filed;
   - the **release checklist** asks "every task in this release: tests promoted, gaps filed?";
   - the **post-mortem** asks which bug of the release no test would have caught — and that test is written.

## 7. Trust — the flakiness rules

A test that fails sometimes teaches everyone to ignore failures (Law 12: an alarm on the normal path is noise). So:
- **fixed data** (§5.1) and **a fixed clock** where dates matter (the "today / yesterday" labels);
- **wait for conditions, never fixed sleeps** ("the toast appeared", not "wait 2 seconds");
- **a fresh browser profile** for each run; stop what a test started by its exact process id (Law 5);
- **a flaky test is fixed — or set aside, with a TODO — the same day.** Never tolerated, never "just re-run it".
- **A failing test is read first, not fixed first** (Law 3, 7.25.0): it may be the protection working.

## 8. What stays manual (a short list per release)

- **Amazon's live pages** — the fetchers against the real site (fetcher *logic* can be tested against saved pages kept
  privately; the live run stays a release step).
- **Taste** — how it looks and reads.
- **A real phone** (Android, and an iPhone — Ron has access to one) until device testing is automated.

## 9. Where it starts

- **Before 2026-11-04:** five function-test files (~87 checks), each run by hand with `node test/<file>`, each with its
  own copy of a `test()` helper whose first failure stopped the file; the two relay scripts; nothing ran on commit.
- **Built 2026-11-04 (branch `feature/carry-over`):** the parse check (`PARSE-001`–`010`); **`test/harness.js`** — the one
  shared helper (stable IDs, a failure is counted and the file carries on); the five files moved onto it with headers
  and IDs (`BFIELD-`, `MERGE-`, `DATE-`, `ORG-`, `OVERLAY-`); **`tools/run_tests.py`** (`RUN-001`–`013`); headers on the
  relay scripts (tier 3 — skipped unless `--relay-url` names a relay: `test-phase1.mjs` defaults to the dev relay
  otherwise); **the commit hook runs tier 1 for what changed** (pre-commit step 7). 9 files, ~110 checks.
- **Step 2 of the order of work** ("Carry over the utilities project's improvements…") builds:
  1. ✅ the parse check (tier 1);
  2. ✅ `tools/run_tests.py` with tiers, tags, IDs and `--changed`; the existing files get `tags:` / `covers:` headers and
     IDs; the commit hook runs `--changed`;
  3. ✅ the browser driver (Playwright for Python + Edge) and the small fixture library's first version — `test/ui/rw.py`
     (the shared setup: serve.py on a free port, a fresh Edge profile, Restore through the real menu, console / crash /
     relay-and-Amazon request detectors, GoatCounter answered empty, and `hover()` / `click_reachable()` — the real
     pointer, refusing a covered or zero-size target and naming the cover: PRINCIPLES Law 8), `test/ui/harness.py`, the fixture
     (`test/fixtures/make-small-fixture.js` → `small-fixture.json`: 23 books, every ownership kind), and
     `APP-001`–`004` (the app opens cleanly; the fixture restores; every left-pane count; still clean after) and
     `DRV-001`–`003` (the driver's own reachability checks). ~50 s a
     run today — the in-browser compile; the precompile cuts it;
  4. the first screen tests — from anomaly reporting and the Delete key fix (step 4), each starting from a failing test.
- **Built 2026-11-05 (branch `feature/logging`):** **Cloud Sync in screen tests** — `App(relay=True)` starts a **local
  relay** (`rw.LocalRelay`: Cloudflare's own emulator, `wrangler dev --local`, running relay-worker.js with an empty
  store made for the run and deleted after; the test page's address allowed for that run only, wrangler.toml untouched;
  stopped by its exact process tree), points the app at it and gives the fresh profile a made-up test channel (planted at
  run time — never in a data file). `app.upload_fetch(items)` sends books as the library fetcher does;
  `app.import_from_relay()` runs File → Import from Relay. First use: `IMPORT-001`–`005`
  (`test/ui/test_import_from_relay.py`), whose `IMPORT-004` reproduces the Import's false "repair" (LOGGING.md F5)
  before its fix. Adds ~5 s to a run. Known noise gained one entry: a new, empty channel's two "not found" answers.
- From then on, every task follows §6.
