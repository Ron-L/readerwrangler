# Message codes — generated, do not edit

_Written by `py tools/message_codes.py` from every `rwLog.log(…)` call in the code (docs/design/LOGGING.md §6). The commit check refuses a commit whose copy is out of date. Support: find the code a user reports; the level says how serious it is._

90 numbered codes. (205 general lines — info and debug, coded by their area alone — not listed.)
