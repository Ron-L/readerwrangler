## 🎯 What Worked Well

### 1. **Phased Approach**
- User provided detailed 7-phase plan from Claude.ai
- Phases organized logically: logo files → favicons → landing page → app → color palette
- Easy to track progress and verify each phase independently

### 2. **Icon Size Comparison Page**
- Created temporary icon-size-test.html to show sizes (48, 60, 72, 84, 96px) side by side
- User could pick optimal size (84px) without multiple commit/test cycles
- **Lesson**: For visual decisions, provide comparison views rather than iterating one-by-one

### 3. **Feature Branch Workflow**
- Created `feature-logo-blue-palette` branch
- 12 commits during development, squashed to 1 for release
- Clean git history while preserving development flexibility

### 4. **Center-Anchored Positioning**
- Both hero icon and sticky note use `left: 50%; margin-left: ±Npx` pattern
- Elements stay visually balanced when window width changes
- User caught initial absolute left positioning issue; fixed by mirroring sticky note approach

## ❌ Mistakes Made

### 1. **index.html Not Kept in Sync with README.md**
- README.md has "Recent Features" and "Coming Soon" sections
- index.html was missing "Recent Features" entirely
- index.html "Coming Soon" listed completed features (progress bars)
- **Fix**: Added "Recent Features" section, updated "Coming Soon" to match README.md
- **Fix**: Updated SKILL file to note that index.html must be manually synced

### 2. **Recent Features Content Initially Wrong**
- During release prep, replaced v4.1.0 features with v4.5.0 in README.md
- User correctly noted v4.5.0 (styling) is not user-significant; v4.1.0 (wishlist/hide) is
- **Fix**: Reverted to keep v4.1.0 features in Recent Features section

### 3. **Multiple Icon Size Iterations**
- Tried 24px → 40px → 50px → 84px before settling on final size
- Should have created comparison page sooner
- **Lesson**: For visual tuning, create comparison views upfront

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### 1. **index.html and README.md Are Separate**
- Landing page (index.html) doesn't pull from README.md
- Must manually keep "Recent Features" and "Coming Soon" sections in sync
- Updated SKILL-Development-Ground-Rules.md to document this

### 2. **Visual Fixes Pattern: Test → Report → Fix**
- User noted: when in test/report/fix cycle for visual issues, just fix without asking
- Speeds up iteration for obvious adjustments

### 3. **User-Significant vs Developer-Significant Features**
- Logo/color changes are developer-significant (infrastructure)
- Wishlist/hide features are user-significant (behavior changes)
- "Recent Features" should highlight user-significant changes
