# v4.13.0 Post-Mortem - 2026-01-10

## Release Summary
**Insert Column Before/After** - Column creation from dropdown menu

## What Shipped
- `insertColumn(referenceColumnId, position)` function for precise column placement
- "Insert Column Before" and "Insert Column After" menu items in column dropdown
- New column enters edit mode immediately for naming
- Removed floating "Add Column" button from far right

## Housekeeping
- Removed version badge from README.md (single source of truth now in app)
- Updated SKILL file release checklist to reflect this change

## What Went Well
- Quick win identified from real workflow pain point (scrolling to far right to add column)
- Clean implementation - reused existing patterns (column dropdown, edit mode)
- UX discussion led to better solution than original floating button
- Collaborative step-by-step process caught the README badge sync issue

## What Could Be Improved
- Nothing significant - straightforward feature

## Lessons Learned
- User's own workflow observation ("My pattern is Add Column, name it, filter, drag...") is the best source of UX improvements
- Single source of truth principle applies to version numbers too
- Removing complexity (floating button) can improve UX more than adding features

## Technical Notes
- `insertColumn` uses `splice()` for array insertion at specific index
- Same analytics event (`/event/column-created`) used for both old and new column creation methods
- Column dropdown menu now has logical grouping: Sort → Auto-divide → Insert Divider → Insert Column → Rename/Delete

## Time Spent
- ~30 minutes total (feature + release)
