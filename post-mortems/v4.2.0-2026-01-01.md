## What Went Well

1. **Add Column float implementation** - Clean solution using flex container, tested and worked immediately
2. **Release checklist** - SKILL file checklist made release process systematic
3. **Branding consistency** - Libre Baskerville font and tagline add polish

---

## Challenges

1. **Context compaction mid-release** - Session was compacted while in the middle of the release checklist; continuation summary helped resume correctly
2. **README sync issue** - User edited README on GitHub (dev remote), required fetch from correct remote and prod/dev sync

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Verify remote before GitHub edits** - When editing on GitHub, confirm which repo (dev vs prod) is being edited
2. **Release checklist works** - Step-by-step checklist prevented missed items
