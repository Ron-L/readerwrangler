serve.py — ReaderWrangler's local development server (2026-10-15).

Python's standard web server, with the one difference that matters: it serves only what the real site serves.
Production (GitHub Pages) publishes exactly the files in git and never lists folders, so this server refuses:

  1. any path with a part starting with a dot   (.private/ — secrets; .git/; .claude/; .vscode/ …)
  2. anything git ignores                       (readerwrangler-backup-*.json — they hold relay credentials; scratch files)
  3. folder listings                            (a folder with an index.html still shows that page)

Refused paths get a plain 404, as if they didn't exist.

It also BUILDS on demand (2026-11-10, TODO "Faster loading"): the page loads the app compiled ahead of time from
dist/; a request for a compiled copy whose source changed rebuilds it first (tools/build.py). A source that doesn't
compile is served as a script that throws the compiler's message, so the page's error screen shows it.

It listens on the whole home network ON PURPOSE (a phone tests your local copy over Wi-Fi) — which is exactly why it
must not hand out private files to every device on that network. Same address and port as before
(http://localhost:8000), so everything the browser stores for ReaderWrangler stays put.

Usage:  py serve.py [port]        (default 8000; Windows: double-click it if .py files open with Python, and a
                                   shortcut to it in the Startup folder — Win+R -> shell:startup — starts it at logon)
        python serve.py [port]    (elsewhere)
Needs git on the PATH (it asks git what's ignored); exits with a clear message if git isn't there.
