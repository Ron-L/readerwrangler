"""
local_relay.py — a local relay for the relay tests (tier 3): relay-worker.js in Cloudflare's own emulator on this PC
(`wrangler dev --env dev --local`), on a free port, with an empty store made for the run and deleted after
(docs/design/TESTING.md §3; TODO "Turn more of our working rules into automatic checks", item 3; 2026-11-12).

    relay = LocalRelay()
    url = relay.start()     # waits for wrangler's "Ready on …" line; RelayError (loud, with the end of its output) if not
    ...                     # run the tests against url
    left = relay.stop()     # [] when everything it started is gone AND its ports are free — else what's left, in words

Never the dev or production relay: the address is always http://127.0.0.1:<the port it chose>.

Stopping (PRINCIPLES Law 5, Law 12 — 7.28.0: ending the shell that started a relay left workerd and three node
processes serving its port, caught only by checking the port): every process it started is listed by exact id — with
its start time, so a reused id is never taken for ours — each is stopped by its exact id (`taskkill /PID <id> /F`; never
`/T`, which follows parent ids that Windows reuses; never by name or pattern), and then it is CHECKED: each listed
process gone, each port no longer listening.
Anything left is reported by id and name and never stopped here — a process we can't show we started isn't ours to stop.
