# Screen test: File → Import from Relay brings a fetch's new books in — filed in the Inbox, with no false "repair".
# tags: import, sync, relay, integrity, tier 2
# covers: readerwrangler.js, relay-client.js, integrity.js, relay/relay-worker.js
# Run: py tools/run_tests.py --tier 2     (or directly with the venv's Python). Starts its own LOCAL relay (rw.LocalRelay)
# with a throwaway test channel — never the dev or production relay.
#
# IMPORT-004 is TODO "Import files new books once, before the integrity check…" part 1 (LOGGING.md finding F5): today
# Import's library load runs the integrity check while the new books are in no folder yet, so it "repairs" them into the
# Inbox and logs a repair on every normal Import. Written to fail before the fix (Ron's rule: a bug fix starts with a
# failing test). IMPORT-006 runs first, while the channel is still empty; IMPORT-007 is the task's part 2.
