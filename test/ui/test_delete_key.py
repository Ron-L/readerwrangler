# Screen test: the Delete key acts on what you SELECTED — never on the folder you happen to be in.

# TODO "The Delete key deletes the folder you're in — not the folders you selected" (id 20261014-1030ay), and the Delete
# rows of "the one table" (docs/design/ONE-TABLE.md §3). Until 7.28.1, Delete with no BOOKS selected deleted the folder you
# were INSIDE, whatever folders you had selected — and an empty one went with no question; in the Folders view it did
# nothing at all. Decided (Ron + UX, 2026-10-22): selected books; else the folders selected in the right pane; else — only
# when the left pane has your focus — the folder highlighted there; with nothing selected, nothing. Several folders: one
# confirmation listing them, one undo for the lot. The key and the right-click Delete use one operation.
# 7.28.1-alpha.2 (Ron, 2026-11-12, review queue Q-013): books AND folders selected → Delete takes both, in one confirmation
# and one undo, as File Explorer does (was: the books only) — DELKEY-009, 012–015.
# Real keys and real clicks throughout; every row that deletes is undone with Ctrl+Z and checked back.
# The fixture (test/fixtures/make-small-fixture.js): Science Fiction (3 books) ⊃ Space Opera (no books) ⊃ Old Favorites
# (2 books); Fantasy ⊃ The Test Saga; Every Ownership Kind; An Empty Folder; the Inbox (2 books).
