# Screen test: Restore Backup's messages — a file we refuse on purpose is the person's file (a warning, BACKUP-07),
# never our bug (an error); a restore that works says what it brought back.
# tags: restore, backup, logging, tier 2
# covers: readerwrangler.js, logger.js
# Run: py tools/run_tests.py --tier 2     (or directly with the venv's Python)
#
# 2026-11-08 (7.26.0-alpha.12, the logging switch's BACKUP area): Restore's failures were three console.error lines
# each, and every failure looked the same. Now one entry each: a file the load refuses on purpose (an old Collections
# file, a damaged or pre-2.0 library) is a warning, BACKUP-07; anything else is an error, BACKUP-04, with the stack.
