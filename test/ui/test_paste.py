# Screen test: pasting books — Ctrl+V and the right-click menu's Paste — in every kind of place.
# tags: paste, move, booklists, undo, tier 2
# covers: readerwrangler.js
# Run: py tools/run_tests.py --tier 2     (or directly with the venv's Python)
#
# 2026-11-06 (the logging comb's finding F1, then a probe of every place): Ctrl+V refused the Inbox (the menu allowed
# it), and a cut pasted into a Book List or the Trash took the book out of its folder and put it NOWHERE, then said
# "Pasted 'X' into 'folder'" — two hand-kept copies of one paste that knew only folders. 7.25.1-alpha.2: one paste
# (pasteClipboard) and one answer to "can books be pasted here?" (pasteRefusal). The decided behavior ("Move and copy
# books anywhere", decisions 2-4, re-checked 2026-11-06): a copy into a Book List adds; a cut MOVES (out of the folder
# it came from, onto the list), and a book leaving its LAST folder goes to the Inbox, which the receipt says.
# Each paste row is undone with Ctrl+Z and checked back — so every row also tests its undo, and rows stay independent.
# The fixture: "A Book With No Description" is filed only in Science Fiction; "Written Together" in Fantasy AND Science
# Fiction (test/fixtures/make-small-fixture.js).
