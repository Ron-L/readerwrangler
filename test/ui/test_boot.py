# Screen test: starting up — the build line; a damaged status note no longer stops the library; a library that can't
# be loaded is shown to EVERY user, with advice that fits, and Save Backup refuses to save half a library.
# tags: boot, logging, storage, backup, tier 2
# covers: readerwrangler.js, storage.js, logger.js, readerwrangler.html
# Run: py tools/run_tests.py --tier 2     (or directly with the venv's Python)
#
# 2026-11-09 (7.26.0-alpha.15, the logging switch's BOOT area): when the library didn't load, the app printed one
# console line — the person saw an empty library and no reason. Now it's critical, BOOT-01: the logging module's box,
# for every user. Its usual advice ("save a backup now") would be harmful here: a start that fails AFTER the books
# appear has no folders on screen, and a backup made then would restore as a library with none — so BOOT-01 carries its
# own advice, and Save Backup refuses until the library has loaded. Found on the way: a damaged library-status note
# (only "how fresh is your library") stopped the whole load; now it's a warning, BOOT-02. The failures are real ones
# (the browser's book store made to fail, before the page's own scripts), not planted messages.
